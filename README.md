# Capstone Project - Big Data Intenship at GridDynamics

## Mision

As a Data Engineer you will need to design and implement some part of the data platform for a data analytics team. Customers have various sources but data is not unified, so we also need to think about data structure. 
We have 3 sources of data that need to be ingested. These sources are updated every day around 12PM.

* We have following sources:
  **RDBMS (Postresql, or MySQL) (WEB) 
  **Parquet files (MOBILE APP) 
  **Json files (PHYSICAL STORE) 


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
